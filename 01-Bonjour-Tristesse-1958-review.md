# Bonjour Tristesse (1958) Film Review

On a rooftop, Johnny listens to a tragic story from his best friend. He chuckles and replies with "What a story, Mark". This iconic scene from *The Room* ran through my mind multiple times while watching *Bonjour Tristesse*. It is an unnatural reaction that downplays the seriousness of the scene, but makes it more memorable than it probably should be. Maybe *Bonjour Tristesse* is not as serious as the title suggests. The name translates to "Hello, Sadness" in English. Nowadays, a movie with that name sounds like it could be a joke and just one step away from ironically playing "The Sound of Silence" by Simon & Garfunkel. Considering that *Bonjour Tristesse* was released in 1958, a few years before that song was written, it seems like there is a slight chance that this movie could be ahead of its time. The narration in this film throws that mindset out of the window and implies that the drama is meant to be taken seriously. Filled with gorgeous scenery of the French Riviera, *Bonjour Tristesse* features an awkward yet memorable performance by Jean Seberg that derails the enjoyment of an otherwise solid story.

 Jean Seberg plays Cecile, a 17-year-old on vacation in the French Riviera. Her life is filled with luxury and relaxation as she spends most of her days swimming and relaxing on the beach. She is joined by an older gentlemen, Raymond, and his lover, Elsa. It would appear that Raymond has a stronger relationship with Cecile than with Elsa, who is later described as a "playmate". The age difference alone makes the chemistry troubling. Even more worrying is that Raymond is not just an older gentleman, but also her father. Nothing inappropriate happens between Cecile and Raymond, but the behavior is odd. When Raymond invites an old friend, Anne, to stay with them, Cecile quickly becomes jealous. Cecile's relaxing way of living may be coming to an end.

Whatever happens on this vacation has a lasting impact on Cecile. The story is actually told in a series of flashbacks. This results in striking visual transitions when the initially black-and-white film jumps to color. I was confused when I saw the animated and colorful opening credits fade away to a black-and-white scene. The scenes without color take place after her summer vacation. We see Cecile driving around town, going to various parties and being generally unhappy. She dances with a man at a club. Instead of looking at her partner, she stares off into the distance and into the eyes of a singer. We hear an internal monologue about the dullness of her relationship, ultimately describing it as "a hopeless waste of time". This is a stark contrast to her behavior throughout the majority of the film. It is almost as if the loss of color represents the loss of innocence. Colorful scenes from her past present an energetic Cecile.

Cecile's overwhelming energy is also what causes the movie to fall apart. The differences in tone between the black-and-white and color scenes show that actress Jean Seberg is capable of showing a wide range of emotions. Without the glimpse into her future, it would be near impossible to figure out that Cecile was actually devastated by any of the events in the film. For the most part it feels like Jean Seberg is in a high school English class, just reading lines in a bubbly voice instead of trying to portray a character. It does not help that the script in general feels fake. While other characters display more than one emotion, they are still talking unnaturally, almost as if the movie was a parody about fancy living. It gets tiring quickly.

Looking further into the background of this movie, it is actually based off of a 1954 French novel of the same name. Wikipedia says that the author, Francoise Sagan, was 18 years-old when the book was published. If the script for this film was lifted from the book, that would explain the general awkwardness that gets in the way of delivering the story. I am considering reading the book to see if something got lost in translation. Did I mention that despite being based off of a French book, having a French title and taking place in France, this movie is actually in English? I understand that making the film in English attracts a wider audience, but it is baffling that the title would be kept the same. 

One thing that does not get lost in translation is the scenery. Overall, the beach setting makes the film pleasing to look at. For those interested in the portrayal of gambling on film, we get an inside look at a French casino. This is not the first time I have seen a French casino in a movie made during the 1950's. The portrayal seems similar with table games being all the rage. Casino betting chips are larger than modern-day chips and actual cash bills are even larger. Speaking of large things, one character, Elsa, is often seen wearing ridiculous hats. At one point I was convinced that she was just wearing a weaved basket on her head. It just looked impractical. Long and wide straps dangle from the hat and need to be held close to her chest for balance. I am pretty sure a gust of wind could easily knock it off her head.

*Bonjour Tristesse* had the opportunity to tell a story with a whirlwind of emotions, but it falls short due to an uneven performance by lead actress Jean Seberg. There are much better Jean Seberg films to watch. Movies such as *Call Me by Your Name* are also better at telling the story of a 17-year-old vacationing in Europe.
