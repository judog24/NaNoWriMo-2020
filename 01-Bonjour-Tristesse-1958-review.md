# Bonjour Tristesse (1958) Film Review

On a rooftop, Johnny listens to a tragic story from his best friend. He chuckles and replies with "What a story, Mark". This iconic scene from *The Room* ran through my mind multiple times while watching *Bonjour Tristesse*. It is an unnatural reaction that downplays the seriousness of the scene, but makes it more memorable than it probably should be. Maybe *Bonjour Tristesse* is not as serious as the title suggests. The name translates to "Hello, Sadness" in English. Nowadays, a movie with that name sounds like it could be a joke and just one step away from ironically playing "The Sound of Silence" by Simon & Garfunkel. Considering that *Bonjour Tristesse* was released in 1958, a few years before that song was written, it seems like there is a slight chance that this movie could be ahead of its time. The narration in this film throws that mindset out of the window and implies that the drama is meant to be taken seriously. Filled with gorgeous scenery of the French Riviera, *Bonjour Tristesse* features an awkward yet memorable performance by Jean Seberg that derails the enjoyment of an otherwise solid story.

~~"Bonjour Tristesse" or "Hello, Sadness" sounds like a satirical title, like that one song, "hello darkness, my old friend".
The movie has an odd tone to it.~~
The lead character's narration makes it seem like she is going through a rough time in her life, but throughout the movie she is talking in a bubbly voice.
It was almost like listening to line readings in a high school English Class.
~~It reminded me of "The Room" where the script is written dramatically but Tommy is reading lines very unnaturally.~~

The scenery in this film, the French Riviera, is pleasing to look at, but made me wish I was watching "Call Me By Your Name". 
Some interesting fashion choices, mainly one character's selection of hats, might be the most entertaining part of this movie.
I was convinced at one point she was just wearing a basket on her head.

This is another movie that gives me insight into French casinos.
Bills are large, almost like a postcard.
Table games are all the rage.
