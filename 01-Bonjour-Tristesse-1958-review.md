# Bonjour Tristesse (1958) Film Review

"Bonjour Tristesse" or "Hello, Sadness" sounds like a satirical title, like that one song, "hello darkness, my old friend".
The movie has an odd tone to it.
The lead character's narration makes it seem like she is going through a rough time in her life, but throughout the movie she is talking in a bubbly voice.
It was almost like listening to line readings in a high school English Class.
It reminded me of "The Room" where the script is written dramatically but Tommy is reading lines very unnaturally.

The scenery in this film, the French Riviera, is pleasing to look at, but made me wish I was watching "Call Me By Your Name". 
Some interesting fashion choices, mainly one character's selection of hats, might be the most entertaining part of this movie.
I was convinced at one point she was just wearing a basket on her head.

This is another movie that gives me insight into French casinos.
Bills are large, almost like a postcard.
Table games are all the rage.
