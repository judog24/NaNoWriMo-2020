# Night Nurse (1931) Film Review



---

One of the most interesting things is seeing a 1930s hospital. Hospitals may be common in movies, but we hardly get an inside look at the inner-workings of them. I can't say how accurate things are, but it is interesting to see surgery being performed. An air bag is attached to the patient's mouth. When the patient stops breathing, emergency oxygen is used, but it is rolled out slowly.

Even nurse training is interesting. It is like a convent. The nurses are forced to live there and follow strict rules. There is a creepy induction ceremony. 

A many only known as the bootlegger arrives at the hospital. He becomes a potential love interest. He steals milk to make an emergency milk bath. The funny thing is that this guy with so many connections didn't know you can just get milk at a grocery store.

The movie feels like two combined together with both of them being great. The first half is about training to become a nurse while the second deals with heavier subject matter such as malnutrition and alcoholism. Regardless of what is happening, Barbara Stanwyck is determined to get the job done.
